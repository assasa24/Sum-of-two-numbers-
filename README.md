# Sum-of-two-numbers-
This project checks if there are 2 numbers in an array which equal to a given sum, using 3 algorithims:
. naive algorithm
. recursive algorithm 
. An algorithm which uses a stack instead of a recursion.
The user enters size, values to an array and a number. After that the 3 algorithms run and check the above mentioned
